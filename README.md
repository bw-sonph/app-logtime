MY NOTE

1. How do I solve: Error: Failed to list Firebase projects.

```
  firebase login --reauth
```

2. Deploy Firsebase

```
  firebase deploy
```

3. Switch branch

```
firebase use <project-name>
```

4. Firebase init hosting

```
  firebase init hosting
```

5. Need to set up the GitHub Action part of Hosting

```
  firebase init hosting:github
```

6. To run against a different Firebase project but still use the same project directory

```
  firebase use --add
```
